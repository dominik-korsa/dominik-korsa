![Two hard problems](assets/two-hard-problems.png)

Hi there! üëã
I'm a **Theoretical Computer Science** student at the Jagiellonian University, **Krak√≥w, Poland**. I spend my free time making *things*. The *things* include mostly programming projects, but I'm also interested in electronics and 3d printing. Check out a list of some of the *things* that I made or contributed to:

## üåê [plan.dk-gl.eu](https://plan.dk-gl.eu) - [[Source](https://github.com/dominik-korsa/timetable)]
<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="./assets/timetable.png" alt="Timetable logo">

This is a school timetable app - it can load and parse VULCAN Optivum timetables (using [another project of mine](https://github.com/wulkanowy/timetable-parser-js)) or load data from an [API for V High School in Krak√≥w timetable](https://github.com/cloud11665/vlott).

### Technologies and features:
- **Fully responsive** and **mobile first** - works great on mobile and on desktop
- Very **customizable** - users can select their groups, hide lessons they don't attend, choose favourite classes change the color scheme and more
- Has a built-in [**classroom map**](https://plan.dk-gl.eu/v-lo/room) for the V High School. 
- Has a **combined view**, where a user can see the timetables of all the classes at once
- Build using **Vue 3** and **Quasar**
- Progressive Web App (**PWA**)
- **Caching** - timetable data is stored locally so the app works even when offline and loads almost instantly

## üì± [Wulkanowy](https://wulkanowy.github.io/) - [[Source](https://github.com/wulkanowy/wulkanowy/blob/develop/README.en.md)]

A mobile app, with over **1 million downloads on Google Play** for accessing VULCAN Uonet+ school registers. This is quite a big project with over 20 contributors.

I've also worked on related projects, like the timetable parser mentioned before, a Discord bot for the Wulkanowy community and the project's website. 

## üéÆ [Discord Integration](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discord-integration.91088/) - [[Source](https://github.com/dominik-korsa/discord-integration)]

## üåê [D≈ºamnikowa Informatyka](https://dzamnikowa-informatyka.web.app/) - [[Source](https://github.com/dominik-korsa/dzamnikowa-informatyka)]
A web app for creating resources to teach programming. Teachers can create materials and exercises, written in markdown. Students can send back their solutions to the exercises, which are then graded by a teacher.

### Technologies and features:
- Made in **Vue.js** and **Vuetify**

An app for realtime bidding, useful for tabletop games like Monopoly. Supports three types of auctions:

- **Dutch** - the price gets lower as time passes, until someone accepts the current price.
- **Sealed-bid** - players bid once, without seeing the offers of other bidders. The player who bids the highest price wins.

Uses **Vue.js**, **Vuetify** and a custom **Socket.IO** backend.

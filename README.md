Hi there! 👋
I'm a high school student in **Kraków, Poland**. I spend my free time on a lot of cool programming projects. I'm also interested in electronics and 3d printing. Check out my favourite projects below:

## 🌐 [plan.dk-gl.eu](https://plan.dk-gl.eu) - [[Source](https://github.com/dominik-korsa/timetable)]

This is a school timetable app - it can load and parse VULCAN Optivum timetables (using [another project of mine](https://github.com/wulkanowy/timetable-parser-js)) or load data from an [API for V High School in Kraków timetables](https://github.com/cloud11665/vlott).

### Technologies and features:
- **Fully responsive** and **mobile first** - works great on mobile and on desktop
- Very **customizable** - users can select their groups, hide lessons they don't attend, choose favourite classes change the color scheme and more
- Has a built-in [**classroom map**](https://plan.dk-gl.eu/v-lo/room) for the V High School. 
- Has a **combined view**, where a user can see the timetables of all the classes at once
- Build using **Vue 3** and **Quasar**
- Progressive Web App (**PWA**)
- **Caching** - timetable data is stored locally so the app works even when offline and loads almost instantly

## 📱 [Wulkanowy](https://wulkanowy.github.io/) - [[Source](https://github.com/wulkanowy/wulkanowy/blob/develop/README.en.md)]
<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="./assets/wulkanowy.png" alt="Wulkanowy logo">

A mobile app, with over **1 million downloads on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.wulkanowy&utm_source=homepage)** for accessing VULCAN Uonet+ school registers. This is quite a big project with over 20 contributors.

I've also worked on related projects, like the timetable parser mentioned before, a Discord bot for the Wulkanowy community and the project's website. 

## 🎮 [Discord Integration](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discord-integration.91088/) - [[Source](https://github.com/dominik-korsa/discord-integration)]

A plugin for [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) servers that allows to sync messages in a Discord server and Minecraft chat.

Very customizable, has over **2000 downloads**. Check the [listing on Spigot Hub](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discord-integration.91088/) for a list of features.

Written in **Kotlin**, uses **Discord4j**, makes use of **Kotlin coroutines**.
